A simple drawer in Python.

Press Ctrl + L to draw lines.
Press Ctrl + R to draw rectangles.
Press Ctrl + E to draw ellipses.

Press Ctrl + S to save your work in .pcd file format.
Press Ctrl + O to open your drawings and admire them.

NOTE: 	Colors are chosen randomly for each new element you draw. 
	Do not edit the .pcd file on your own, because you will corrupt them.
